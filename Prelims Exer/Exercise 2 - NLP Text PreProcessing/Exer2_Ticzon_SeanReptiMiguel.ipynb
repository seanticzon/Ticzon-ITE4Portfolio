        "News tends to have an immoral impact on society and civic life, on one hand acting as a vital source of information for the people, while on the other, acting as a spy against the misdeeds of the mighty. The impact of news on people's decisions can be both positive and negative. Where news through newspapers is able to make people judge situations rationally, false news sometimes leads to grave social chaos or political uprise. It also changes the human perception of some of the existing affairs of the world. Sometimes, receiving nice news may make a person more confident, hopeful, and sufficient. However, not-so-nice news may also bring about certain psychological changes. The foremost cause of such changes is the vast increase in the quantity of reports on crimes, accidents, and suicides. Reports of this nature negatively affect the capability of human beings to remain emotionally balanced.\n",

That was the purpose of the polls rigged by overweighting Hillary supporters in the samples. After weeks of hearing poll results that Hillary was in the lead, the public would discount a theft claim. Electronic voting makes elections easy to steal, and I have posted explanations by election fraud experts of how it is done. \\nClearly the Oligarchy does not want Donald Trump in the White House as they are unsure that they could control him, and Hillary is their agent. \\nWith the reopening of the FBI investigation of Hillary and related scandals exploding all around her, election theft is not only more risky but also less likely to serve the Oligarchy\\u2019s own interests. \\nImage as well as money is part of Oligarchic power. The image of America takes a big hit if the American people elect a president who is currently under felony investigation. \\nMoreover, a President Hillary would be under investigation for years. With so much spotlight on her, she would not be able to serve the Oligarchy\\u2019s interests. She would be worthless to them, and, indeed, investigations that unearthed various connections between Hillary and oligarchs could damage the oligarchs. \\nIn other words, for the Oligarchy Hillary has moved from an asset to a liability. \\nA Hillary presidency could put our country into chaos. I doubt the oligarchs are sufficiently stupid to think that once she is sworn in, Hillary can fire FBI Director Comey and shut down the investigation. The last president that tried that was Richard Nixon, and look where that got him. \\nMoreover, the Republicans in the House and Senate would not stand for it. House Committee on oversight and Government Reform chairman Jason Chaffetz has already declared Hillary to be \\u201ca target-rich environment. Even before we get to day one, we\\u2019ve got two years worth of material already lined up.\\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said investigation will follow the evidence. \\nIf you were an oligarch, would you want your agent under this kind of scrutiny? If you were Hillary, would you want to be under this kind of pressure? \\nWhat happens if the FBI recommends the indictment of the president? Even insouciant Americans would see the cover-up if the attorney general refused to prosecute the case. Americans would lose all confidence in the government. Chaos would rule. Chaos can be revolutionary, and that is not good for oligarchs. \\nMoreover, if reports can be believed, salacious scandals appear to be waiting their time on stage. For example, last May Fox News reported: \\n\\u201cFormer President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender\\u2019s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the \\u201cLolita Express\\u201d \\u2014 even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. \\n\\u201cClinton\\u2019s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein\\u2019s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including \\u201cTatiana.\\u201d The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.\\u201d \\nFox News reports that Epstein served time in prison for \\u201csolicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on \\u2018Orgy Island,\\u2019 an estate on Epstein\\u2019s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\\u201d http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html Some Internet sites, the credibility of which is unknown to me, have linked Hillary to these flights. http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/ \\nThis kind of behavior seems reckless even for Bill and Hillary, who are accustomed to getting away with everything. Nevertheless, if you are an oligarch already worried about the reopened Hillary email case and additional FBI investigations, such as the one into the Clinton Foundation, and concerned about what else might emerge from the 650,000 emails on former US Rep. Weiner\\u2019s computer and the NYPD pedophile investigation, putting Hillary in the Oval Office doesn\\u2019t look like a good decision. \\nAt this point, I would think that the Oligarchy would prefer to steal the election for Trump, instead of from him, rather than allow insouciant Americans to destroy America\\u2019s reputation by choosing a person under felony investigations for president of the United States. \\nBeing the \\u201cexceptional nation\\u201d takes on new meaning when there is a criminal at the helm. (Reprinted from PaulCraigRoberts.org by permission of author or representative)\",\n          \"Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is suspending his campaign for president after a disappointing finish in Iowa, turning his focus now to his Senate re-election bid.\\n\\n\\\"Across the country thousands upon thousands of young people flocked to our message of limited government, privacy, criminal justice reform and a reasonable foreign policy. Brushfires of Liberty were ignited, and those will carry on, as will I,\\\" the Republican said in a statement.\\n\\n\\\"Although, today I will suspend my campaign for President, the fight is far from over,\\\" he continued. \\\"I will continue to carry the torch for Liberty in the United States Senate and I look forward to earning the privilege to represent the people of Kentucky for another term.\\\"\\n\\nThe libertarian-leaning senator finished a distant fifth in the Hawkeye State on Monday evening, unable to replicate the strong coalition that his father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, had built there four years ago.\\n\\nHis prospects were similarly bleak both in national polling and in New Hampshire, which is up next Tuesday. Left off the main debate stage last month for his poor standing in surveys (he instead boycotted the so-called undercard debate), Paul faced being passed over again at Saturday's GOP debate.\\n\\nHis end-of-the-year campaign finance report showed a depleted bank account, too, with just $1.3 million remaining.\\n\\nAnd Paul, unlike his rivals, had another campaign he was running simultaneously to worry about \\u2014 his Senate re-election bid. Though the first-term senator starts with the advantage in the GOP-leaning state, he drew a strong Democratic challenger last month in Lexington Mayor Jim Gray.\\n\\nPaul had to jump through hoops just to be able to run for both Senate and president at the same time. Last year he persuaded the state party to hold a March caucus instead of a May primary so he could legally be on both ballots. That political insurance policy he won't need anymore was costly \\u2014 he had promised he would pay for the change, which could be upwards of $500,000.\",\n          \"On Sunday during an appearance on \\\"Face the Nation\\\" on CBS, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) tried to downplay the differences between the GOP leadership and the conservative rank and file in the House.\\n\\n\\\"We do have some members who disagree, from time to time, over the tactics that we decide to employ,\\\" Boehner said at one point. \\\"We get in an argument over tactics from time to time,\\\" \\u00a0he said at another. \\\"The goals are all the same.\\\"\\u00a0That line was echoed by House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) during an interview with Chuck Todd on NBC's \\\"Meet the Press.\\\"\\u00a0\\\"We have a difference of opinion in strategy and tactics, but in principle we are united,\\\" McCarthy said.\\n\\nThose statements are only half true.\\n\\nThe true part is that Boehner, McCarthy and the rest of the House GOP leadership team do have a broad strategy and a series of tactics they try to employ to both accomplish their legislative goals and pressure President Obama. Whether that's \\\"Plan B,\\\" Boehner's attempt to avert the fiscal cliff while simultaneously forcing Obama's hand, or the latest attempt to extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security for three weeks, Boehner, McCarthy and the rest have a strategy behind most of these big legislative fights. (The lack of a back-up plan, on the other hand, is a little odd.)\\n\\nThe untrue part is that the rump Republican resistance \\u2014\\u00a0led by a handful of tea party-aligned conservatives \\u2014\\u00a0has its own alternative strategy or even tactics. Think back to the vote for speaker earlier in this Congress. \\u00a0The establishment had a plan to get Boehner reelected to the House's top job. The resistance? Not so much. They nominated three alternatives to Boehner \\u2014\\u00a0Dan Webster of Florida, Ted Yoho of Florida and Louie Gohmert of Texas \\u2014\\u00a0ensuring that the anti-Boehner vote was splintered. What did that reveal? That even in making a purely protest vote, there wasn't a whole heck of a lot strategy going on in the not-Boehner crowd.\\n\\nFast forward to Friday's vote on the three-week extension backed by Boehner. Yes, the conservative coalition in the House was absolutely the key to killing that measure. But to what end? What is the broader strategy of voting that extension down? The answer that group will give you is to tie the repeal of Obama's immigration executive orders to funding DHS. But that is never going to happen. Even if Senate Democrats allowed a vote on such a joined package and it passed, which wouldn't happen, Obama would veto it without a second thought. And we would be right back where we started.\\n\\nThis is a classic letting-the-perfect-get-in-the-way-of-the-good approach. It is neither a strategy nor a tactic to say \\\"we will get everything we want or there will be no deal.\\\" Saying \\\"no\\\" isn't a strategy. Jeb Bush addressed that reality during his question-and-answer session at CPAC last week. \\\"It's good to oppose bad things,\\\" Bush said. \\\"We need to start being for things.\\\"\\n\\nThat's what Boehner \\u2014\\u00a0and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \\u2014\\u00a0have been saying for quite some time. The problem for Boehner and, to a lesser extent, McConnell, is that they are not dealing with a group of members who see the world as they do. While Boehner et al are trying to draw up a broad strategy of how to approach the final two years of Obama's presidency, the resisters in the House are taking it issue by issue \\u2014\\u00a0and always standing on ideological ground to oppose Obama.\\n\\nOpposition without a plan of what to do next is neither a tactic nor a strategy. That's why John Boehner may have the most difficult job of any speaker in modern history.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"FAKE\",\n          \"REAL\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "Donald Trump endorsed an unabashedly noninterventionist approach to world affairs Monday during a day-long tour of Washington, casting doubt on the need for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and expressing skepticism about a muscular U.S. military presence in Asia.\n",
            "\n",
            "The foreign policy positions — outlined in a meeting with the editorial board of The Washington Post — came on a day when Trump set aside the guerrilla tactics and showman bravado that have powered his campaign to appear as a would-be presidential nominee, explaining his policies, accepting counsel and building bridges to Republican elites.\n",
            "\n",
            "On Monday night, Trump delivered a scripted address in front of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, prompting ovations with pledges to stand by Israel and take a hard line on peace talks with the Palestinians.\n",
            "\n",
            "Trump’s whirlwind day of appearances around the nation’s capital was intended in part to head off an establishment push to deny him the Republican Party’s nomination. But in the Post meeting, the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the GOP’s long-held orthodoxies.\n",
            "\n",
            "During the hour-long discussion, during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers, Trump advocated a light footprint in the world. In spite of unrest in the Middle East and elsewhere, he said, the United States must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\n",
            "\n",
            "“At what point do you say, ‘Hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ ” Trump said in the editorial board meeting. “I know the outer world exists, and I’ll be very cognizant of that. But at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Trump said U.S. involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in Washington. “We certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said, adding later, “NATO is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting Europe with NATO, but we’re spending a lot of money.”\n",

            "\n",
            "Throughout his unlikely campaign, Trump’s unpredictable, incendiary persona has been his rocket fuel. But with the nomination now within his reach, he is trying at times to round out his sharp edges to convince his party’s leaders — not to mention general-election voters — that he has the temperament and knowledge to be president.\n",
            "\n",
            "This was one of Trump’s goals as he addressed AIPAC’s annual conference in Washington. For perhaps the first time in his campaign, Trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters — a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using.\n",
            "\n",
            "On Israel, Trump mostly hewed to the party line, giving a full-throated defense of the nation and its interests and arguing that no candidate is a more forceful champion of the Jewish state. His eyes pinging back and forth between the teleprompter screens, Trump embellished his prepared text only to deliver a few criticisms of President Obama and his first-term secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner.\n",
            "\n",
            "“When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One,” Trump vowed. He received enthusiastic applause from the crowd of thousands, and the much-rumored walkouts during his speech were either called off or went unnoticed in the cavernous Verizon Center arena.\n",
            "\n",
            "Earlier Monday, Trump sought to cultivate ties with his party’s establishment at a private luncheon he hosted on Capitol Hill. It was attended by about two dozen Republicans, including influential conservatives in Congress and prominent figures from GOP policy and lobbying circles.\n",
            "\n",
            "Those with whom he met directly urged Trump to “be more presidential,” according to one attendee. This person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session, described it as “a very serious conversation,” adding: “This was the Donald Trump who talks with bankers, not the Donald Trump who is on the stage.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Trump also sought to showcase his business acumen and dealmaking prowess. He staged an afternoon news conference at the historic Old Post Office Pavilion, which his real estate company is turning into a Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. The candidate, flanked by employees wearing hard hats, led journalists on a tour of the construction zone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Trump’s visit to Washington comes amid an intensified effort by some in the Republican establishment, including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to deny him the nomination by forcing a contested convention at which the party could rally around an alternative.\n",
            "\n",
            "At his luncheon meeting, Trump warned party leaders against using parliamentary maneuvers to block his nomination. He later told reporters that he had a productive conversation recently with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and that he has “many millions of people behind me.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Now, they can play games, and they can play cute,” Trump said of Ryan and other GOP leaders. “I can only take [Ryan] at face value. I understand duplicity. I understand a lot of things. But he called me last week, he could not have been nicer. I spoke with Mitch McConnell, he could not have been nicer. If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Neither Ryan nor McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, attended Monday’s meeting with Trump. It was held at Jones Day, the law firm of Donald F. McGahn, a Trump campaign attorney, and was convened in part by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a key Trump ally.\n",
            "\n",
            "Attendees included Heritage Foundation President Jim De­Mint, a former senator from South Carolina and a conservative movement leader, as well as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former House Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston (R-La.). A group of House members who have endorsed Trump also attended.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We met with Senator Sessions and some of the great people in Washington,” Trump said. “We had a really good meeting. . . . They can’t believe how far we’ve come because, you know, I think a lot of people maybe wouldn’t have predicted that.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Trump began the day at The Post, where his on-the-record meeting with the editorial board covered media libel laws, violence at his rallies and climate change, as well as foreign policy.\n",
            "\n",
            "For the first time, Trump listed members of a team chaired by Sessions that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies: Keith Kellogg, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Walid Phares and Joseph E. Schmitz. All are relatively little known in foreign policy circles, and several have ties to the George W. Bush administration.\n",
            "\n",
            "Trump praised George P. Shultz, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, as a model diplomat and, on the subject of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, said America’s allies are “not doing anything.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we’re doing all of the lifting,” Trump said. “They’re not doing anything. And I say: ‘Why is it that Germany’s not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? . . . Why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially, the third world war with Russia?’ ”\n",
            "\n",
            "While the Obama administration has faced pressure from congressional critics who have advocated for a more active U.S. role in supporting Ukraine, the U.S. military has limited its assistance to nonlethal equipment such as vehicles and night-vision gear. European nations have taken the lead in crafting a fragile cease-fire designed to decrease hostility between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.\n",
            "\n",
            "Trump sounded a similar note in discussing the U.S. presence in the Pacific. He questioned the value of massive military investments in Asia and wondered aloud whether the United States still is capable of being an effective peacekeeping force there.\n",
            "\n",
            "“South Korea is very rich, great industrial country, and yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do,” Trump said. “We’re constantly sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games — we’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Such talk is likely to trigger anxiety in South Korea, where a U.S. force of 28,000 has provided a strong deterrent to North Korean threats for decades.\n",
            "\n",
            "Asked whether the United States benefits from its involvement in Asia, Trump replied, “Personally, I don’t think so.” He added: “I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we’re a poor country now. We’re a debtor nation.”\n",

The apply method hits, along with the function lambda, changes all entries of column 'text' to lowercase, hence ensuring all text data is uniformly formatted. Afterwards, the head() will be used to show the first ten rows of the now-modified DataFrame. This step helps in preserving the consistency of the text data, which is very important for correct text analysis and comparisons, and for the capability to see at once the ways in which the data has changed.\n"

if you were hillary, would you want to be under this kind of pressure? \\nwhat happens if the fbi recommends the indictment of the president? even insouciant americans would see the cover-up if the attorney general refused to prosecute the case. americans would lose all confidence in the government. chaos would rule. chaos can be revolutionary, and that is not good for oligarchs. \\nmoreover, if reports can be believed, salacious scandals appear to be waiting their time on stage. for example, last may fox news reported: \\n\\u201cformer president bill clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender\\u2019s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the \\u201clolita express\\u201d \\u2014 even apparently ditching his secret service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by foxnews.com. \\n\\u201cclinton\\u2019s presence aboard jeffrey epstein\\u2019s boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including \\u201ctatiana.\\u201d the tricked-out jet earned its nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.\\u201d \\nfox news reports that epstein served time in prison for \\u201csolicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. he allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on \\u2018orgy island,\\u2019 an estate on epstein\\u2019s 72-acre island, called little st. james, in the u.s. virgin islands.\\u201d http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html some internet sites, the credibility of which is unknown to me, have linked hillary to these flights. http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/ \\nthis kind of behavior seems reckless even for bill and hillary, who are accustomed to getting away with everything. nevertheless, if you are an oligarch already worried about the reopened hillary email case and additional fbi investigations, such as the one into the clinton foundation, and concerned about what else might emerge from the 650,000 emails on former us rep. weiner\\u2019s computer and the nypd pedophile investigation, putting hillary in the oval office doesn\\u2019t look like a good decision. \\nat this point, i would think that the oligarchy would prefer to steal the election for trump, instead of from him, rather than allow insouciant americans to destroy america\\u2019s reputation by choosing a person under felony investigations for president of the united states. \\nbeing the \\u201cexceptional nation\\u201d takes on new meaning when there is a criminal at the helm.

(the lack of a back-up plan, on the other hand, is a little odd.)\\n\\nthe untrue part is that the rump republican resistance \\u2014\\u00a0led by a handful of tea party-aligned conservatives \\u2014\\u00a0has its own alternative strategy or even tactics. think back to the vote for speaker earlier in this congress. \\u00a0the establishment had a plan to get boehner reelected to the house's top job. the resistance? not so much. they nominated three alternatives to boehner \\u2014\\u00a0dan webster of florida, ted yoho of florida and louie gohmert of texas \\u2014\\u00a0ensuring that the anti-boehner vote was splintered. what did that reveal? that even in making a purely protest vote, there wasn't a whole heck of a lot strategy going on in the not-boehner crowd.\\n\\nfast forward to friday's vote on the three-week extension backed by boehner. yes, the conservative coalition in the house was absolutely the key to killing that measure. but to what end? what is the broader strategy of voting that extension down? the answer that group will give you is to tie the repeal of obama's immigration executive orders to funding dhs. but that is never going to happen. even if senate democrats allowed a vote on such a joined package and it passed, which wouldn't happen, obama would veto it without a second thought. and we would be right back where we started.\\n\\nthis is a classic letting-the-perfect-get-in-the-way-of-the-good approach. it is neither a strategy nor a tactic to say \\\"we will get everything we want or there will be no deal.\\\" saying \\\"no\\\" isn't a strategy. jeb bush addressed that reality during his question-and-answer session at cpac last week. \\\"it's good to oppose bad things,\\\" bush said. \\\"we need to start being for things.\\\"\\n\\nthat's what boehner \\u2014\\u00a0and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) \\u2014\\u00a0have been saying for quite some time. the problem for boehner and, to a lesser extent, mcconnell, is that they are not dealing with a group of members who see the world as they do. while boehner et al are trying to draw up a broad strategy of how to approach the final two years of obama's presidency, the resisters in the house are taking it issue by issue \\u2014\\u00a0and always standing on ideological ground to oppose obama.\\n\\nopposition without a plan of what to do next is neither a tactic nor a strategy. that's why john boehner may have the most difficult job of any speaker in modern history.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"FAKE\",\n          \"REAL\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

explained why america is indispensable and exceptional theblogmire brings you an exclusive piece in which mrs clinton explains why an indispensable and exceptional nation must have an indispensable and exceptional leader \\nwarning may contain traces of satire \\nif theres one core belief that has guided and inspired me every step of my career in public service its this i am an exceptional woman a great unselfish compassionate woman to paraphrase robert kennedy and when you add up all my advantages its clear im indispensable too  someone all others can look to for leadership \\nand what im really excited about is not just that im indispensable but that im about to become president of the indispensable nation an indispensable nation needs an indispensable woman an indispensable woman needs an indispensable nation its a match made in heaven which is why i am asking you to help me break the glass ceiling on november 8th  so that together we can become even more exceptional than we already are \\nso what makes me so indispensable \\nim indispensable in part because of my love for our armed forces our military is the greatest in history with the best troops training and technology and i believe it is a travesty that we are not using it to its full potential its essential we do everything we can to support our men and women in uniform and i intend to do just that by sending our brave soldiers on important missions around the globe from day one of my presidency \\nim indispensable because of my commitment to the truth throughout my career ive always sought to stay close to the truth i know that theres a lot of folks out there who say im corrupt but those who know me closest will tell you that this isnt the real hillary ask those who know me best ask my husband bill hell tell you ask my campaign chairman john podesta hell tell you ask lloyd blankfein ceo at goldman sachs hell tell you ask some of our closest allies in places like saudi arabia theyll tell you they will all tell you about the real hillary and that my commitment to honesty and fighting corruption is second to none it may even be my most exceptional quality alongside humility \\nim also indispensable because of my network of alliances and supporters you only have to look at who they are has there ever been a candidate in the entire history of our exceptional nation that has managed to get the backing of the entire media and corporate america i dont think so but it does tell you something doesnt it i humbly submit that it speaks volumes that some of the most important people in our exceptional country are prepared to place their trust in me \\nim indispensable because unlike donald trump i dont need to rely on the help of people like vladimir putin and countries like russia to help get me elected can you imagine me having to rely on putin and russia to get elected of course ive had to bring putin and russia up in this campaign from time to time not because i want to keep bringing putin and russia into it in fact the only reason ive occasionally mentioned putin and russia is not because i want to keep talking about putin and russia but because i have to keep taking about putin and russia because trump is depending on putin and russia to get him elected and so i have to draw attention to putin and russia but trust me if i had my way i wouldnt bring putin and russia up at all \\nim indispensable because of my commitment to helping countries get rid of their dictators and establishing democracy and peace like libya for example we came we saw he died and the libyans got their liberty \\nmost of all im indispensable  and exceptional  because of my values \\ntake my commitment to human rights which i have shown by being one of the most vocal supporters of a womans right to terminate her pregnancy right up to a few seconds before the thing inside her becomes a human \\ntake my commitment to raising money which my husband and i have shown through our tireless work with the clinton foundation and in making hundreds of speeches for various organisations \\ntake my commitment to making the world a better place which ive shown time and time again by saying things like love trumps hate which it does doesnt it im proud of that expression \\nbut with all of these advantages comes responsibility  i need to lead the world you need me to lead the world because if i fail to lead i will leave a vacuum that lets extremists putin and russia haters bigots the intolerant putin and russia the severely backwards  the julian assanges of this worldputin and russia  baskets of deplorables  take root everywhere \\nof course being exceptional doesnt mean that other people dont also have something to offer  maybe they do but i have an unparalleled ability to be a force for peace progress and prosperity around the world which i intend to demonstrate on day one of my presidency by standing up to putin and russia and showing putin and russia whos boss \\nill never stop doing good never thats what makes me great im good because im great and ill tell you one thing ill never stop \\nthats why im indispensable \\nlets keep me exceptional did you enjoy this

            "trumps whirlwind day of appearances around the nations capital was intended in part to head off an establishment push to deny him the republican partys nomination but in the post meeting the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the gops longheld orthodoxies\n",

            "during the hourlong discussion during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers trump advocated a light footprint in the world in spite of unrest in the middle east and elsewhere he said the united states must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nations crumbling infrastructure\n",

            "at what point do you say hey we have to take care of ourselves  trump said in the editorial board meeting i know the outer world exists and ill be very cognizant of that but at the same time our country is disintegrating large sections of it especially the inner cities\n",

            "this was one of trumps goals as he addressed aipacs annual conference in washington for perhaps the first time in his campaign trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters  a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using\n",

            "those with whom he met directly urged trump to be more presidential according to one attendee this person who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session described it as a very serious conversation adding this was the donald trump who talks with bankers not the donald trump who is on the stage\n",

In this script, each text enter is processed by the apply method, and it tokenizes the sentences into words. The tokens that are produced are placed into a new column called 'tokenized_text'. This procedure is paramount in preparing the text data for further analysis—like frequency or sentiment analysis—since it breaks down a continuous flow of text into manageable, distinct pieces: the words.\n"
