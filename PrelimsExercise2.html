                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-2">First Comment: I feel, Mr. Ticzon can do to improve this project is the examination and evaluation of some specific preprocessing techniques. While their work provides very nice coverage of why preprocessing is important, deeper analysis on how different methods impact various NLP tasks is needed. For example, granular comparison of tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming, and how these interacted with the performance of machine learning models, would have added a lot of value to their findings. This could be improved on by relating such preprocessing techniques to exact challenges in the dataset they are working on about the language itself, noise, or variability of text structure. It would also benefit from including a section on the limitations of preprocessing techniques in and of themselves, and how these might affect the outcomes of subsequent NLP tasks. In this regard, based on my experience, some methods of preprocessing do improve the quality of data significantly, but if applied inappropriate, they can introduce bias or scrub important contextual information. Discussion of these possible trade-offs at appropriate places will make their work paint a clearer picture on how preprocessing impacts data analytics. Nevertheless, my work supports only the general ideas brought forth by my colleague, emphasizing the high importance of preprocessing in NLP and that there are a lot of useful ideas concerning news article analysis. However, I will argue that closer and deeper looks at certain techniques of preprocessing, which I did in my work, give more relevance and applicability to his findings. Their work may, therefore, ring more effectively towards the niche of NLP and data analytics if only inculcation of more profound analysis and handling of the specific challenges in their dataset have been taken care of.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-2">Second Comment: The paper titled "Why SpaceX Should Be the First Company to Venture into Mars" by Sean Repti Miguel P. Ticzon provides a compelling argument for why SpaceX is uniquely positioned to lead the first human expedition to Mars. The introduction effectively engages the reader and clearly states the paper's purpose, outlining the significance of Mars exploration and SpaceX's role in it. The paper is specific and arguable, providing a clear direction for the paper. The content is well-organized, with each section building on the previous one to strengthen the argument. The author uses strong evidence and logical reasoning to support their claims, making a persuasive case for SpaceX's capabilities and vision. Overall, the paper is clear and well-written, effectively conveying the author's viewpoint on the topic.</p>
