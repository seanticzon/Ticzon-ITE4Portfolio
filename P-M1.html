                        It timely applies regular sentiment analysis to the student feedback collected and uses the Naive Bayes and SVM models in particular. A logical approach to solving the problems has been used and the time table adopted is perfectly reasonable. However, unstructured data may pose a challenge to actionable insights, due to the fact that they are brought into the model without prior structure. The increase of attention to data preprocessing may improve the quality of analysis. The research focuses on an important question in the field of education, which outlines the approach to sentiment analysis specifically and clearly. The application of multiple models shows that it is systematic. This research could have benefitted from a more detailed conversation on the data preprocessing strategies to enhance the management of unstructured feedback.

                                SYNNER group talking about public datasets and the approach of directly contacting educational institutions to source proprietary data. How exactly this raw data is going to be checked for completeness and relevance is not precisely known. the proposal agree that qualitative feedback may yield no helpful insights but does not clarify what this will be transformed into so that practical advice becomes available to school authorities. The timeline proposed is too short and does not outline clear objectives for each segment of the study.

                                I don’t know what happened, but I think our work was assigned to me. Since it happened this way, I will just try to look at our work in a third person perspective so that I can judge it accordingly. 



                                First, I want to point out that the powerpoint presentation has paragraphs making it a little too cramped. It should be in bulleted form to point out the key points. There’s two timelines of the study, but it did not explicitly mention the dates and the objectives for each day or week. 
                                
                                
                                
                                In the document file, it was not specified what are and how many data sources are going to be used. It is also a little vague and complex if you look closely into it. The timeline of the study did not follow the Gantt Chart format, making it out of place. Hopefully we can fix this, along with the other peer reviews to create a more specific output and inclined to the project’s objectives.                            </p>

                                For SYNNER group, using sentiment analysis to evaluate student feedback after school events is clear and well-structured. It effectively outlines the problem of handling unstructured feedback data and the need to transform it into useful insights for school improvement. Using models like BERT, Naive Bayes, and SVM is a practical choice, as each provides unique advantages for analyzing sentiment.



                                The objectives are aligned with the goal of providing practical insights, and the methodology covers key steps from data collection to model training. However, the proposal could benefit from simpler language in some sections and perhaps more specific examples of expected outcomes. Overall, this project shows a good approach to applying sentiment analysis in education and could genuinely help schools understand and act on student feedback.</p>

                                It is noticeable that there are weaknesses that the SYNNER Project Proposal is showing based on their IEEE report, which complicates its feasibility and comprehension: One significant flaw is no Gantt chart, or semblance of one in the form of a pipeline which hinders in tracking back the project timeline and realization of how tasks will be achieved and when. This paper also lacks a comprehensive elaboration of the sentiment analysis models or model architecture which brings out issues on the planned method for analyzing the feedback. Unfortunately, there are no specific models mentioned and architectures make it very hard to determine the appropriateness of the chosen techniques on educational feedback data.



                            Also, the proposal lacks important points of concern as regards text preprocessing. It has left out how the unstructured feedback will be standardized and the kind of control that will be put in place to deal with challenges such as slang, and spelling, and colloquial language. Additionally, the proposal does not envision multiple-language feedback, which would be highly problematic since analysis would be accompanied by language detection and translation preprocessing steps. These oversights might mean that the problem is not sufficiently deep to deal with the issues of realistic sentiment analysis, and more detailed preparation of approaches to these problems is necessary. All in all, it gives a rather vague and incomplete impression of the proposal and its links to the actual ways of applying NLP to analyze educational feedback.</p>
